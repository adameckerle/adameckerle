### Hi there, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently Director, Technical Marketing at Rubrik, Inc. I enjoy collaborating with others, building cool content, and being a communicator.
Prior to Rubrik, I worked for VMware in various roles. Personally, I love motorcycles, racing, and anything to do with space exploration.
